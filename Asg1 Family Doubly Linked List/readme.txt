This is a family doubly linked list created as a college assignment in Data Structure course. 
In this assignment I have created a doubly linked list in which all the members of the family are sorted in order of their relationship. 
All the grandparents will come first then their child and then their grandchild. 
If we have more than one member having the same relation, then they all will be sorted according to their age. 

Various options available when you run the file. You can choose which operation you want to perform by specifying corresponding option number. 
Note that all the code are case specific.
